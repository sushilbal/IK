        " - If A is an n × n matrix, then it has n eigenvalues and n corresponding eigenvectors (not necessarily distinct).\n",
        "\n",
        " - If A is a symmetric matrix, then its eigenvalues are real and its eigenvectors are orthogonal.\n",
        "\n",
        " - If A is a real matrix, then its complex eigenvalues occur in complex conjugate pairs, and its eigenvectors may have complex entries.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The product of the eigenvalues of A is equal to the determinant of A.\n",
        "\n",
        " - If A is invertible, then its eigenvectors form a basis for the vector space on which A acts.\n",
        "\n",
        " - The trace of A (i.e., the sum of its diagonal entries) is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues.\n",

        "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are used in a variety of applications, such as solving systems of differential equations, diagonalizing matrices, and performing spectral analysis. They are also important in machine learning and data analysis, where they are used for dimensionality reduction and clustering."
